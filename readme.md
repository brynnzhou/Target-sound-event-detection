## Inroduction
This is the source code of "Detect what you want: Target Sound Detection", we have submit this paper to ICASSP2022, and we will realse the paper to arxiv soon.
### first step ---> data process
Please first download the Urbansound-sed dataset and Urbansound8K dataset. <br/>
After that, please run the following commond:<br/>
python data/extract_feature.py <br/>
<strong> if a mixture audio include N envents, so that we can generate N samples.
sample styleï¼š filename_event  target_event   mel_feature  time
eg.  soundscape_test_bimodal0_gun_shot.wav  gun_shot  [[0,1],[1,1]]   [[],[]]
</strong>
In our experiments, we randomly choose embedding according to class name.

### How to run code
bash bash/tsd.sh


### Join train
please run bash/jtsd.sh

### TO do list
We will upload our extracted feature and trained model in the future. <br/>
We only realease the fully supervised training code, the weakly training code is similar with this. If you need it, please let me known.
